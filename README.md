### **Configure Firebase**

Follow the setup instructions for both **Android** and **iOS**:

1. **Add Firebase to your Android Project:**
   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Add a new project (if you haven't already) and configure Firebase for Android by following the [Android setup guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup).
   - Download the `google-services.json` file and add it to the `android/app` directory in your project.

4. **Configure Firestore:**
   - Set up a Firestore database in the Firebase Console.
   - Define security rules for Firestore. You may start with rules that only allow authenticated users to read/write their own data.

5. **Configure Firebase Storage:**
   - Go to Firebase Storage in the Firebase Console and set up storage rules.
   - You can define rules to restrict access to certain files or users if needed.
